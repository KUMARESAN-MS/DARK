          <h2>Winden Caves</h2>
          <p>The Winden Caves are a system of underground caverns beneath the small German town. These caves contain passages that lead between time periods and serve as the primary setting for temporal experiments. They are the heart of the conspiracy, where the God Particle was created and where time travel is made possible.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ancient cave systems with unexplained geometric structures</li>

        <div class="scifi-content">
          <h2>33-Year Time Cycle</h2>
          <p>The loop is defined by 33-year cycles that repeat endlessly. Every 33 years, the same events occur in slightly different ways across generations. Children disappear, families are torn apart, and secrets resurface. This pattern creates a temporal echo where history rhymes across decades, with characters unknowingly repeating the actions of their ancestors.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Repeating disappearances separated by 33-year intervals</li>
            <li>Generational patterns that bind families across time</li>

        <div class="scifi-content">
          <h2>God Particle</h2>
          <p>The God Particle is a dark matter phenomenon created through nuclear experiments. It serves as the fundamental force behind time travel and temporal manipulation. This particle can breach the fabric of spacetime itself, allowing passage between different time periods and alternate realities. Its discovery is both a blessing and a curse for the people of Winden.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Dark matter substance created in nuclear reactor accident</li>
            <li>Source of temporal anomalies and time travel capabilities</li>

        <div class="scifi-content">
          <h2>Time Machine</h2>
          <p>Two primary devices are used for time travel: a metallic chair that harnesses the God Particle for temporal displacement, and a portable suitcase device that allows travel across smaller time gaps. Both require the God Particle to function and were designed with the bootstrap paradox in mind. They are the central tools that enable the entire conspiracy.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Chair-based time displacement device powered by dark matter</li>
            <li>Portable suitcase time machine for targeted temporal jumps</li>

        <div class="scifi-content">
          <h2>Parallel Worlds</h2>
          <p>Two identical worlds exist in quantum entanglement, both containing Winden and its inhabitants. They diverged at a critical moment when different choices were made. Both worlds experience the same 33-year cycles and apocalyptic events simultaneously. Characters can travel between worlds, encountering alternate versions of themselves with different histories and fates.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Quantum entangled realities with identical inhabitants</li>
            <li>Divergent outcomes from critical decision points</li>

        <div class="scifi-content">
          <h2>Bootstrap Paradox</h2>
          <p>The bootstrap paradox creates a closed loop where the time machine is both created and discovered by the same people across different time periods. Information and objects exist without ever being created, violating causality. This paradox is the fundamental structure of the Dark universe, where origin and destination become indistinguishable, and time feeds upon itself.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Information exists without being created by anyone</li>
            <li>Creator and creation become temporally cyclic</li>
